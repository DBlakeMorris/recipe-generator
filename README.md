# Grandma's AI Recipe Generator

An AI-powered recipe generator that creates delicious recipes using a Gemini API - it was crafted for my Grandma as a quirky Xmas gift! ðŸŽ…

## Features
- Generate recipe ideas from ingredients
- Get detailed cooking instructions
- Save favorite recipes
- Intuitive UI

## How to Use
- Simply list the food ingredients of your choosing in the first box - ideally seperated with a comma (e.g., salmon, potatoes, peas).
- In the second box, i.e., 'any special requests' feel free to state your preferences such as "not spicy", "French style", "Marco Pierre-White inspired" or "serving only 3 people" - be as imaginitive and 'picky' as you wish.
- Select from a list of 5 recipes, should none be to your liking, tune the output by adding further information to the two boxes as appropriate. However any majoy changes (like how many people are to be served), simply reset and try again.
- At the bottom of each generated recipe, there is a button "Save to Grandma's Pantry" click this for each of your favorte recipes for later use - held in the "Grandma's Pantry" tab!
